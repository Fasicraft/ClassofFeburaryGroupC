How to create local repo and push to Remote repo
-----------------------------------------------------
step 1-- create folder on desktop
step 2-- go to terminal(for MacOS),gitbash for window
step 3-- For window, go to the folder and add txt file. For MacOS, add txt file by using command line, touch filename.txt   and then,   echo write message >> filename.txt
step 4-- go to your terminal or gitbash then,  git add .  or git add filename   note:- git add . will add all the .txt files we created all together. 
step 5-- git status   ,to see if our .txt file is on stage, and ready to be commited
step 6-- git commit -m "I added a newfile or any message"    , this will save our change to the local repo with a comment
step 7-- git status   , this will show us the status of our commit. If it say nothing to commit your working file is clean, that means we are good to go. yeaa lol

Now that our local repo is ready it's time to push to the remote repo on Github.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step 1-- download git hub and create account
step 2-- go to new and create a repo same as the local repo that we already created 
Step 3-- then copy the URL and go to terminal or gitbash
step 4-- git remote add origin URL
step 5-- git push -u origin master       ,if master didn't work just change master to main

viol√†  our file, the local repo is pushed to the remote repo. we can go to Github and check if we did it correctly.

If everything is correct that means we are done with the first pathway.

Good job group C!
